Greetings from my Github page! At CCT College in Dublin, I'm a driven student who is interested about advancing my knowledge and gaining practical experience in the technology industry. I believe in taking measured risks to attain my goals and produce meaningful products since I am a quick learner and problem solver.

I'm a cooperative person who enjoys working in teams. Working with like-minded people that are enthusiastic about technology and have the same objective of developing novel solutions that have an impact makes me very happy.

I'm looking forward to finding an internship position where I can use my knowledge and talents to work on worthwhile initiatives. I'm willing to roll up my sleeves and get started on any project, whether it involves data analysis, database management systems, or machine learning.

My abilities and interests are demonstrated on my Github page. You'll find a range of projects that show my proficiency in a number of programming languages, including Python, MySQL, and C. I've worked on tasks including developing websites, designing machine learning models, and doing data analysis.

I'm eager to work with a group where I can share my knowledge, discover new things, and advance the cause. So please don't hesitate to get in contact if you're seeking a motivated and skilled intern who's eager to take on new challenges. Together, let's do something fantastic!
